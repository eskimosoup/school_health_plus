INSERT INTO `case_studies` VALUES (1,'Chiltern Primary School','Chiltern Primary School, a community school with 360 pupils aged 3-11, is in the heart of the most deprived area of a very deprived city.','<p>Parents in The Boulevard community and surrounding areas ofHullface poor housing conditions and widespread unemployment. Those who do work often are holding down two or more low paid jobs to make ends meet.</p>\r\n<p>During the last 5 years the area has seen a significant influx of immigrant workers which has driven the ethnicity of the school up to around 18% and has brought a vast culture mix and 26 different languages to Chiltern. Eastern European countries represent the largest group of newcomers to Chiltern and although the multi-ethnic mix in school often presents many challenges, these children have, in general, had a very positive effect on school life because of their excellent work ethic. Despite its challenges theChilternPrimary Schoolprovides a happy, safe learning environment and achieves just under 95% attendance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>School Health+</strong> Services</p>\r\n<p>The Head, Mrs Lynne Clarke, explained; <em>\"I decided to buy in extra school nursing services direct from CHCP CIC because we are aiming for beyond 95% attendance. We believe, with the help of the school nurse, it is definitely achievable at Chiltern. Working closely with my team in school, the school nurse is targeting persistent absentees. She is helping and advising parents in school and doing home visits where necessary offering healthcare support to bring children back into school.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>Joanne Robinson, who qualified as a school nurse 5 years ago with a Public Health Degree, is the nurse allocated toChilternPrimary School. The nurse\'s focus is primarily attendance. Apart from holidays in term time, by far the biggest area of concern for the school was medical non-attendance. The school had noticed patterns of non-attendance where entire families would go off sick together. Also some families were keeping children at home for long periods disproportionate to the nature of their illness &ndash; e.g. 3 weeks for chicken pox.</p>\r\n<p>The school has excellent measures in place for managing and rewarding good attendance. Certificates and prizes are given out regularly to children with 100% attendance weekly, monthly, termly and yearly.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs Clark told us: <em>\"The bigger the achievement the bigger the prize. We give stickers out in assembly every week to children with 100% attendance and at the other end of the scale, last year, we gave a bike to a Year 6 boy who had achieved 100% attendance for six whole years. But this was exceptional and obviously not the norm. Some parents take attendance very seriously and value education whilst others see us as a child minding service, taking the decision to keep their child off school far too lightly. We do everything we can to encourage good attendance but there is a hard core of persistent non-attenders who often give ill health as their reason for not being in school. This is where the school nurse is a must.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>For a member of school staff with no medical training it is very difficult to combat or question medical non-attendance or even to offer advice. We need a healthcare professional in school because not only can she establish very quickly if a child is indeed fit for school, but school nurse is also qualified to advise parents. When Joanne Robinson says it is time to send a child back into school, parents listen and they appreciate and trust the professional health advice now available at Chiltern.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>As well as attendance the remit of the nurse at Chiltern is far reaching and although <strong>School Health+</strong> is a relatively recent initiative for Chiltern, the Head and the nurse are keen to develop the role further.</p>\r\n<p>The universal, core, school nursing service, provided to all schools as standard, funded by the Government continues as the school nurse does all she can to support high-priority safeguarding issues in school, national health programmes and health promotion but The Head and the School Nurse at Chiltern through <strong>School Health+</strong> many great plans for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs Clarke said: <em>\"Having a healthcare professional in school gives a more rounded picture of the child when the school nurse attends safeguarding meetings because she is able to give a healthcare perspective as well as an educational perspective. Also some of the prevention and health promotion ideas Joanne has brought to Chiltern are excellent. She is pre-empting health issues and I believe this will make a huge difference not only to attendance but to the overall health of our pupils.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>JoanneRobinson (Chiltern\'s School Nurse) said: <em>\"We are promoting <strong>School Health+</strong> to parents and they are now able to drop in and see me with issues. I want to give more basic health information to our parents so they know when it is OK to send a child to school. I am attending parents\' evenings and assemblies and I also have plans to work more closely with GPs and pharmacies in the Chiltern catchment area to ensure we are all on the same page.\"</em></p>\r\n<h2>Early Results At Chiltern</h2>\r\n<p>Mrs Clarke concluded: <em>\"Although it is early days for <strong>School Health+</strong> at Chiltern I am already seeing a significant difference in school pretty much overnight. Parents are taking advice well from the school nurse and they have confidence in her. I can see children back in school following home visits, when from the non-attendance patterns I have seen before, I know they would not have been back without Jo\'s involvement.\"</em></p>','Chiltern_Case_Study_lower.jpg','','',NULL,1,'2012-03-23 10:24:16','2012-04-26 09:50:35',NULL,NULL),(2,'The Parks Primary School','Serving an area of extreme social deprivation, The Parks Primary School on North Hull Estate has 314 pupils ranging from age 3–11.','<p>This community has many serious problems ranging from drug and alcohol abuse to domestic violence and everything in between. As a result the school has very high safeguarding case levels and as a result some pupils at the school have significant emotional health needs.</p>\r\n<p>The Parks is a very caring school and its Head, Mrs Cathy Byrne, and her staff have developed an ethos where academic expectations are high and attainment levels are improving steadily. Continually striving to help her pupils reach a level 4 in literacy and numeracy by the time they leave The Parks, Mrs Byrne recognised there was a need in school for someone who could fulfil a role that would help support the children in coping with the challenges and distractions of every day life. The role that is being developed at the Parks to bolster the school\'s efforts is that of \'Welfare for Learning Officer\'. Cathy Byrne explained; <em>\"We deliberated long and hard about what kind of person we wanted for this role. We considered employing our own social worker or education welfare officer but in the end we felt the option of a qualified and experienced school nurse ticked more boxes for this role.\"</em></p>\r\n<h2>Welfare For Learning Officer - \'Nurse Tracy\'</h2>\r\n<p>Experienced school nurse, Tracy Maull (known to the children, parents and staff as Nurse Tracy) has been seconded to The Parks Primary School by CHCP CIC on a service level agreement to fulfil this new role. She qualified as an RGN in 1987 and has been in school nursing since 2004 and has a specialist community public health degree with a school nursing specialism.Tracyhas worked at the school for some time delivering the core school nursing services, that every school gets, funded by NHS Hull through the Department of Health, but now works at The Parks 3 days a week delivering School Health+ Services (additional school health services bought by schools direct from CHCP CIC).</p>\r\n<p>Cathy Byrne said: <em>\"Nurse Tracy works so closely with us on so many key issues that it is very difficult to separate out and quantify the valued contribution that she is making.&nbsp; It is a true joint effort and because of Tracy\'s involvement we are certainly helping more families and improving the wellbeing of our children to help them focus on learning.\"</em></p>\r\n<h2>School Health+ Services</h2>\r\n<p>Tracy Maull\'s remit at The Parks is predominantly safeguarding and emotional health.&nbsp; Cathy Byrne explained; <em>\"Safeguarding issues can crop up at any time of day and there is no way we, as a school can plan for them or co-ordinate them.&nbsp; These issues are often urgent and before we had the Tracy on board, my Deputy Head Nicky Sansam had to drop everything to deal with them. Nicky was being dragged away from her teaching role far too regularly for far too many hours. She was also working stupid hours - at times until 10 pm at night. Now the two of them share responsibility for safeguarding and Tracy also picks up the emotional health issues that are all too often a by-product of the difficulties children are facing at home.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>Nicky Sansam said: <em>\"Nurse Tracy is seen as a source of help by our families. She is not the school. She is not social services. She is an independent healthcare professional offering a helping hand. It takes a long time to build up trust in a community like ours. Tracy has shaped the role herself and makes an important contribution to the way we run the school. Parents pop in and ask for Tracy\'s help and this is a huge step forward.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>Tracy explained: <em>\"CHCP CIC is a progressive healthcare organisation always looking for new and innovative ways of working and making a difference. Every school has a unique set of needs and my main focus at The Parks is to deal with anything that impacts on the child\'s ability to learn. This can be low level problems such as personal hygiene right through to serious safeguarding issues\".</em></p>\r\n<p>Over 60% of Tracy\'s role at The Parks is safeguarding, dealing with ad hoc situations as and when they arise and attending case conferences and early intervention meetings on behalf of the school. But she also deals with medical absences, ongoing health problems and health care plans at The Parks. She does group work on confidence building and self-esteem and some one-to-one work with children who have anger management issues.</p>\r\n<p>Cathy Byrne added:<em> \"The CHCP CIC service we have brought into for The Parks is very much tailored to the needs of this school. The role is very diverse. As well as the safeguarding Nurse Tracy provides as the major part of her role, she also deals with other wellbeing matters. Additionally Nurse Tracy covers everything from soiling problems, head lice control and promoting healthy packed lunches to helping parents who have mental health issues that affect their children in school \".</em></p>\r\n<p>Although it is early days for \'<strong>School Health+</strong>\' at The Parks and the \'welfare for learning position\' is new and unique, the nurse and the school are working very closely together to develop it for the future. There have been some adjustments on both sides bringing the two professional disciplines together. Education in the school environment is very fast paced and challenging as they must continually work towards attainment achievements and manage distractions. The health care practitioner on the other hand has certain standards to maintain regarding, for example, record-keeping and confidentiality as part of their Code of Professional Conduct. The partnership is making good early progress and beginning to make a difference to children and families.</p>\r\n<h2>Making A Difference</h2>\r\n<p>Cathy Byrne concluded: <em>\"Tracy is not only relieving the pressure as far as our safeguarding case load is concerned, but there are certain things that only a qualified nurse can do. Nurse Tracy obviously has access to medical records enabling her to make sound judgements in this role. Also when healthcare situations crop up in school - for example - \'a child with a slapped cheek infection has a pregnant teacher\' - with Tracy in post we can confidently turn to her knowing we will get well-informed, reliable advice. She has the clout to deal with health and safeguarding related issues and our children and parents trust her.\"</em></p>','Parks_Case_Study_upper.jpg','The Parks Primary School','',NULL,1,'2012-03-23 10:25:41','2012-04-26 10:10:58',NULL,NULL),(3,'The Green Way Primary School','The Green Way Primary School','<p>Attainment through attendance</p>',NULL,'','<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/41485351?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=00AEC5\" width=\"220\" height=\"175\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL,1,'2012-05-03 13:05:28','2012-05-03 13:08:08',NULL,NULL),(4,'Sirius Academy','Sirius Academy','<p>A Holistic Approach to Student Wellbeing</p>',NULL,'','<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/41485350?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=00AEC5\" width=\"220\" height=\"175\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL,1,'2012-05-03 13:09:30','2012-05-03 13:10:43',NULL,NULL);

This development will continue to benefit future generations and the evolving, progressive school and academy alike. Healthier children and young people have above-average attendance rates at school and their attainment goals are met more easily than those who may have become disconnected with their own wellbeing and education.</p>\r\n<p>When we consider the over-arching goals of the school in terms of performance, the integrative, visible and active approach pioneered by the <strong>School Health+</strong> service proves to be essential for the developmental needs of today&rsquo;s children and young people. The school health practitioner is the only person within the school environment who, working directly with clients, has access to the full range of supporting medical information and services to assist in reducing barriers to school attendance and future attainment.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>School Health+</strong> service can be directly aligned to the goals and aspirations of the school or academy. The School Health Team can work with the school or academy to target both individual and specific underlying community issues that may be creating barriers to success.</p>\r\n<p>Opportunities exist for cluster groups of schools to be established and by procuring services collaboratively, can help create pathways to long-term health, attendance and attainment targets within a community. Through cluster group arrangements, the <strong>School Health+</strong> service can develop more impactful relationships with their young clients and work with the school&rsquo;s team to support wellbeing, attendance and attainment plans. These sensible strategies result in long-term positive outcomes for children and success for young people within local communities.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>School Health+</strong> packages can be tailored to the needs of an individual school or group of schools. Support packages include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Attendance booster</li>\r\n<li>Emotional health support package</li>\r\n<li>Emotional health support package</li>\r\n<li>Sex and relationship education programmes</li>\r\n<li>PHSE support</li>\r\n<li>Dedicated safeguarding support and training</li>\r\n<li>Individual programmes</li>\r\n</ul>',NULL,'',0,0,NULL,NULL,'supporting-attendance-and-guiding-school-health-care-choices','2012-03-27 08:26:58','2012-04-26 09:18:16'),(7,'application','snp','Emotional Health','This package of additional school health practitioner support is aimed at Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and Academies where negative behaviour is linked to poor emotional health.','<p><img class=\"image_right\" title=\"Emotional Health Data Sheet (Upper)\" src=\"../../../uploads/chronicler/image/image/8/Emo_Health_Data_Sheet_upper.jpg\" alt=\"Emotional Health Data Sheet (Upper)\" width=\"391\" height=\"260\" />The emotional health package is designed to help improve behaviour by working collaboratively with the discipline team within a school. The school health practitioner can make interventions and act as a catalyst to acknowledge any underlying problems the child or young person may have. This package of additional support is very much a partnership of integrated services providing links with pupils, parents (or carers) to help the school maintain acceptable levels of behaviour. The school health practitioner can address sensitive issues on a one-to-one basis with the individual and take a holistic approach towards physical and mental health, education and lifestyle choices.</p>\r\n<h2>Bringing problems out into the open</h2>\r\n<p>Childhood behavioural issues are rarely unaccompanied by deep emotional stress or turbulence, and it is the School Health team&rsquo;s role to act as a catalyst to acknowledge and understand any deep-seated underlying issues a child or young person may have. Taking an empathic and non-judgemental stand point the school health practitioner will facilitate a strategy on an individual basis that will help the young person come to recognise any presenting issues. The independent and confidential role of the practitioner is often respected by the individual and can have a positive impact on the behaviour and attitudes displayed by a child or young person in school.</p>\r\n<h2>Anxiety and stress-managing techniques</h2>\r\n<p>Often stress can be dealt with by identifying trends and cultural issues within a particular school. For example bullying and heightened peer pressure can build highly stressful situations. The School Health team will apply stress managing techniques and help individuals manage their anxieties on a one-to-one basis. The school health practitioner can offer a confidential service (within safeguarding constraints) that is appropriate to the individual. The practitioner can assist the school with strategies that will help deal with exam-related stress.</p>\r\n<h2>Liaison between, parent, pupil and school</h2>\r\n<p>Providing a listening ear to an unheard child can be repaid with pattern-breaking rewards. The independent and confidential School Health service can provide the child or young person with an opportunity to be heard in the home/school setting. The school health practitioner can help address other issues such as poor parental relationships or ill-health and provide a valuable liaison between parent, child and school. Where there are known risks to emotional health such as domestic violence the school health practitioner can act as an advocate for the child or young person to ensure their needs are addressed within the bigger picture.</p>\r\n<h2>Links and signposting to external agencies</h2>\r\n<p>Referral to appropriate agencies such as the GP, Primary Mental Health Team or Family Assessment and Support Unit (FASU), and liaison with Social Care or the Looked After Children&rsquo;s team can provide a ring of support for a child with complex needs. But similarly, less significant behavioural disturbance may be addressed by signposting the individual to professional counselling or services specific to the behavioural need. The CHCP CIC School Health teams are well placed to engage with or refer to the services of a huge range of specific, needs related health care professionals.</p>\r\n<h2>How to access School Health+</h2>\r\n<p>The <strong>School Health+</strong> team will conduct a needs assessment and tailor a package of support appropriate to each individual school environment. Following this assessment a pilot (try before you buy) will be instigated where the school can evaluate the service and changes in provision can be made as necessary.

The school health practitioner can facilitate early interventions and act as a catalyst for communication with pupils, parents/carers and the school to help break down resistance to improving and maintaining attendance. Working collaboratively with parents, liaison with the GP and other agencies where necessary additional health information can be obtained and explained. Introducing early intervention strategies which may reduce the possibility of problems becoming an established pattern of behaviour.</p>\r\n<h2>Home/school liaison</h2>\r\n<p>The School Health team can facilitate dialogue between pupils, parents, school and professionals and can encourage attendance through unbiased and non-judgemental support. By empowering parents through behaviour management support, improved attendance can be encouraged. Working one-to-one with pupils and by providing information the school health practitioner can promote healthy lifestyles and improve behaviour.</p>\r\n<h2>Issue identification</h2>\r\n<p>Home visiting to assist in the identification of other issues impacting on school attendance and identifying unauthorised and authorised absences can greatly affect accurate attendance-reporting. The school health practitioner can perform a medical history review and identify any behavioural issues that may be affecting attendance, signposting the pupil and family to other agencies where appropriate.</p>\r\n<h2>One-to-one medical absence referrals</h2>\r\n<p>By addressing medical needs to promote school attendance, the School Health team can support pupils with chronic or ongoing medical conditions. The school health practitioner can assist with health care planning and can provide a listening ear to alleviate anxieties by giving reassurance that a child with a medical condition will be safe in school.</p>\r\n<h2>Educational welfare and pastoral support</h2>\r\n<p>Emotional health support is intrinsic to good attendance and this forms a major part of the School Health+ service. Whilst helping schools to address non-productive issues such as bullying and by helping schools to provide an all-round support network for pupils an integrative approach to attendance can be achieved. The School Health team can facilitate parents&rsquo; groups and give extended pastoral and family support.</p>\r\n<h2>How to access School Health+</h2>\r\n<p>The School Health+ team will conduct a needs assessment and tailor a package of support appropriate to each individual school environment.

The school health practitioner can make early interventions and act as a catalyst for communication with pupils, parents (and carers) and the school to help break down resistance to addressing general health promotion issues. Working in a collaborative way with both parent and young people the school health practitioner can access additional relevant health information and provide explanations and early interventions which may reduce the risk of health issues becoming problematic.</p>\r\n<h2>Promoting healthy lifestyles</h2>\r\n<p>The School Health team can facilitate the promotion of healthy lifestyles and minimise risky behaviour that can have a detrimental affect on school-life and performance. By empowering children and young people the school health practitioner can promote wellbeing and help improve attainment through attendance. These measures reflect the PHSE curriculum and support government drivers and can help address community-wide health issues. The practitioners can support national events such as No Smoking Day or Breast Cancer Awareness.</p>\r\n<h2>Addressing whole-school issues</h2>\r\n<p>Where there is an identified public health issue, such as smoking or alcohol abuse that has become prevalent within the local community, the school health practitioner can engage in specific and focused work across the school to help reduce risk-taking behaviours and promote wellbeing. The practitioner can undertake health-promotion teaching packages, health-fairs, health MOTs and other initiatives that will also help in achieving the National Healthy Schools Award.</p>\r\n<h2>Helping teaching staff talk about sensitive issues</h2>\r\n<p>It may not always be appropriate for teaching staff to deliver health promotion lessons around sensitive topics. For example; breast cancer awareness, testicular cancer self-examination, positive body image, diet and nutrition lessons can become challenging for a teacher to deliver. The School Health team is made up of qualified nurse practitioners that have experience in talking about sensitive subjects. A health professional that is independent of the school may be best-placed for this type of subject delivery.</p>\r\n<h2>Focused Support helping to achieve PHSE Ofsted targets</h2>\r\n<p>All schools are measured by Ofsted on a range of grade descriptors including achievement by pupils, quality of leadership and management and quality of teaching. The School Health team can support a school specifically towards Ofsted targets by advising on curriculum, assisting with teaching and the measurement of pupils&rsquo; attainment in this field. CHCP CIC is itself Ofsted inspected and the School Health team is trained and qualified to assist in the preparation and delivery of the Ofsted PHSE curriculum.</p>\r\n<h2>How to access School Health+</h2>\r\n<p>The <strong>School Health+</strong> team will conduct a needs assessment and tailor a package of support appropriate to each individual school environment.

The School Health Team is supported by the Safeguarding Named Nurse for Hull, who ensures that all safeguarding related practice is both evidence-based and child-centred at all times.</p>\r\n<p>CHCP CIC can support school staff with Safeguarding supervision and deliver Safeguarding training to teachers and school staff in safeguarding best-practice and support decisions to make referrals to Social Care. Extra drop-in time (on top of that freely given to all Hull schools) can be arranged to help engagement from a safeguarding perspective.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding the referral process</h2>\r\n<p>The sensitivities around referring can become complex and counter-productive when balanced against the teacher&rsquo;s time constraints. Within the school environment the Child Protection Co-ordinator is the principle decision-maker with reference to safeguarding matters. Each school health practitioner can support the school and its teachers as they have significant depth of understanding around the referral processes, as well as having strong communication channels with other professionals. They may also act as liaison with Social Care teams and other relevant agencies.</p>\r\n<h2>Identifying health needs in children with Social Care involvement</h2>\r\n<p>Each member of the CHCP CIC School Health team is pro-active in identifying health needs in children with Social Care involvement. They can support actions identified in Child Protection Plans, following strategy meetings, and have appropriate report-writing skills suitable to the Social Care environment. They can provide advocacy and additional support for the child or young person when they interface with health, education and Social Care agencies.</p>\r\n<h2>Home/school liaison</h2>\r\n<p>The School Health team can facilitate dialogue between pupils, parents, school and professionals and can support children and young people with Social Care involvement through unbiased and non-judgemental advice and guidance. The team can, through early intervention, provide emotional health support and arrange parenting groups to help the school meet its safeguarding responsibilities.</p>\r\n<h2>How to access School Health+</h2>\r\n<p>The <strong>School Health+</strong> team will work with the school safeguarding lead to identify a package of safeguarding support appropriate to the schools needs.
